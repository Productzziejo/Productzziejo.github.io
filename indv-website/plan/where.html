        <h4><strong>Washington</strong> </h4>
            <p>Grand views of the evergreen state that include endless trees, mountains and serenity. The clean, crisp air will make you feel alive in the northwest. <br>
            Love apples? Washington has the largest selection of local, fresh apples that will make your mouth water. Also enjoy locally grown berries. (All tropical fruit options are imported.) <br>

     <section id="utah">
        <h4><strong>Utah</strong> </h4>
            <p>Utah’s vast views will wow you with clear skies, surrounding mountains and a lot of room for diving, as well as fruit destruction! <br>
            Not much is grown here (unless you want a potato — sorry, that was uncalled for. We don’t provide potatoes), but that just gives us more room to spread out and fall! <br>
            Wanna dive in a snowstorm? Didn’t think so. Enjoy Utah between April 15th and October 1st.  </p>
