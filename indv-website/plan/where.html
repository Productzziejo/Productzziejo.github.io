                        <br> More importantly, all of our tropic fruit options are locally grown and perfectly ripe!
                        <br> Hawaii has seasons, but we don't really know what they are. Dive any time of the year at this location. </p>

                    <h2><strong>Washington</strong> </h2>
                    <p>Grand views of the evergreen state that include endless trees, mountains and serenity. The clean, crisp air will make you feel alive in the northwest.
                        <br> Love apples? Washington has the largest selection of local, fresh apples that will make your mouth water. Also enjoy locally grown berries. (All tropical fruit options are imported.)
                        <br> Dive in Western Washington’s best weather, between June 15th and September 10th </p>

                    <h2><strong>Utah</strong> </h2>
                    <p>Utah’s vast views will wow you with clear skies, surrounding mountains and a lot of room for diving, as well as fruit destruction!
                        <br> Not much is grown here (unless you want a potato — sorry, that was uncalled for. We don’t provide potatoes), but that just gives us more room to spread out and fall!
                        <br> Wanna dive in a snowstorm? Didn’t think so. Enjoy Utah between April 15th and October 1st. </p>
