<h1> Fruit 'Chutes </h1>
    <h2>What is Fruit-‘Chutes?</h2>
    <p>Fall with your fruit. <br>
    Literally skydive among your selection of falling fruits. You can choose one fruit from the menu or a falling special package.</p>
    
    <h3>Browse Our Menu</h3>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>You jump out of the plane and get settled in your dive. Once you’re ready, one of your divine assistants will release the fruit. Watch as some fruits fall at different speeds, fill your beautiful views with some of your favorite fruits falling to their demise. You will have the opportunity to release the fruits parachutes, slowing their fall when you do, until, finally, the fruit will be dropped from their parachutes and let free.</p>
    
    <h2>Why it’s Awesome</h2>
    <p>Spend your last moments of falling filled with the satisfaction that comes from watching fruit crash on the ground below at great speeds, all from your perfect viewpoint in the sky. <br>
    The beauty and awesome explosions of fruit chunks and juices would impress any diver, fruit-loveing or not.</p>
