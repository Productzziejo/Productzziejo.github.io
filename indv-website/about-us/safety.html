        <figure> <img src="../../images/citrus-2791_640.jpg" alt="skydiver eating bannana"></figure>

        <h2>We love not sending people to the hospital!</h2>
        <p>All divers are required to sign waivers upon making a reservation and before the dive, along with going through a safety training on how to enjoy your dive without any risk
            <br> Along with this, every diver is required to fall with a trained, certified professional skydiver that works with our company.
            <br> Only those who are not first time fruit fallers (must have dived with “Fruit Falling” before) and have plan ahead, showing copy of their licensed certification for skydiving, can dive without an instructor strapped to them.</p>

        <h2>IT'S ALL GOOD.</h2>
