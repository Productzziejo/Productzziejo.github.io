        <h1>Worried About Weather? No Worries. </h1>
        <h2>Here's how it works.</h2>

        <p>Skydiving is a weather sensitive art. Our ground control team will begin assessing the weather when operations begin for that day. The weather will be constantly monitored throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>You should make sure to plan to spend a number of hours for your experience. If the conditions are not suitable, your experience may take a little longer.</p>
        <p>While at the drop zone, be sure to pay attention to the announcements.</p>
        <p>If we go on stand-by, this means that we have to put a hold to our skydiving operations. We will keep you updated whether we will stay on stand-by or cancel for the day. </p> 
        <p>If you are unable to skydive due to bad weather conditions, your deposit is totally refundable. You can also ask at manifest to move your reservation to a later date if there is space available in our schedule.</p>

        <p>We'll all do our best to make it easy and awesome!</p>
