The Textbook
Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6
<p>In the HTML & CSS textbook (1st edition2011) are some text elements that are not intended to affect the  structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as html semantic markup.</p>
<p>HTML elements are not used to describe the structure of  the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
<h3>Three types of HTML lists:</h3>

<h3>Creating Links:</h3>
<p>Using the image below  as the folder structure, pretend that you are currently in an html document  located in the <strong>html</strong> folder. Please make <strong>relative</strong> link paths in the html code for the following  to retrieve the instructions.html document (even though you do not have that doc and it will not actually retrieve), to retrieve the instructions.html  as instructed in the names. </p>
<ul>
  <li>instructions.html--from textbook folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from html folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from html5 folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from css folder</li>
  <li>top of page (create a link to go to the very top of this page)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
